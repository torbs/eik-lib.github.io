Eventually, browsers will support Import Maps but currently (October 2020) no browser is shipped with Import Map enabled. 

Chromium based browsers does ship support for Import Maps as an [experimental feature](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5315286962012160) which has to be turned on by enabling the Experimental Productivity Features flag in Chromium based browsers:

 - [Chrome](chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-productivity-features)

 - [Opera](opera://flags/#enable-experimental-productivity-features)
 - [Edge](edge://flags/#enable-experimental-productivity-features)
